Git Branching :- 
In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository. 
Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without 
impacting the main branch. When the work is complete, a branch can be 
merged with the main project.  
We can even switch between branches and work on different 
projects without them interfering with each other.
